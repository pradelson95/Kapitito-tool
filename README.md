**Kappiti** is a tool written in python that acts as a search engine just like google, the difference is that when you want to search something on the internet you type it from a terminal instead of the browser. its main function is to search all possible web pages according to what you have entered to search. Kapiti uses the google api for the search results since creating an api for a search engine is very complex. Kapiti is also able to generate links to related youtube videos based on what you have.
